This is an individual or a team assignment.

1. Add an <b>exit</b> procedure to your cps interpreter. It takes no arguments and exits the rep loop in a controlled fashion.

2. Add a <b>try-catch</b> construct to your cps
interpreter. Have a look at how <a
href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/try-catch/index.html">Racket
does this</a> or talk to me about the details.

3. Convert your recursive interpreter or the cps part 2 interpreter so that it can interpret itself.
You need to implement a <b>load</b> procedure. Have a look at <a
href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/load.html">simple I/O in Racket</a>. You will also have to
develop your own datatypes. Your interpreter should be able to interpret itself at least three
times. If you plan to do this, you need to talk to me first.
