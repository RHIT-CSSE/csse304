## Assignment 13

**Deliverables** : Your code (submit to Gradescope).  

## Programming Problem (115 points)

This is perhaps the most important assignment of the term. The challenge is to understand the set-up of an interpreter, 
how all the components interact to read, parse, evaluate and return a result.

Feel free to start with the code that we studied in class.

This is an interpreter team assignment.

I suggest that you thoroughly test each addition before adding the next one. Augmenting unparse whenever you augment parse 
 is a good idea, to help you with debugging.

**Specification**:  Please implement the following functionality to your interpreter, i.e. parser and interpreter:

- Add the following **literals** to your interpreter:
    - numbers
    - Boolean constants #t, and #f 
    - quoted values, such as '( ) ,  '(a b c) , '(a b . (c)) , '#(2 5 4)
    - string literals, such as "abc" You do not need to add any string-manipulation procedures.
    - vectors You do not need to add any vector-manipulation procedures.
- Add two-armed **if** expressions, i.e., (if test-exp then-exp else-exp).  You’ll add one-armed if (i.e. when) later.  
      Most of the 
      code is in the textbook, but you will have to adapt it to recognize and use Boolean and other literal values–– in 
      addition to the numeric values.  In the book's interpreted language, the authors represent true and false by 
      numbers. In Scheme (and thus in your interpreter), any non-false value should be treated as true.  The number 0 is a 
      true value in Scheme (and in your interpreted language), but 0 is the false value in the textbook's language). 	
- Any **primitive procedures** that are used to evaluate the A13 test cases, including  +, -, *, /, add1, sub1, zero?,  
      not, = and < (and the other numeric comparison operators), and also cons, car, cdr, list, null?, assq, eq?, equal?, 
      atom?, length,  list->vector, list?, pair?,  procedure?, vector->list, vector, make-vector, vector-ref, vector?, 
      number?, symbol?, vector-set!,  display , newline to your interpreter.   Add the c**r and c***r procedures (where 
      each "*" stands for an "a" or "d"). Note: You may use built-in Racket procedures in your implementation of most of 
      the primitive procedures, as I do in the starting code that is provided for you.
- Add **lambda expressions** of the form (lambda (var ...) body1 body2 ...). See the description of rep (short for "read- 
      eval-print") below for a description of what to print if a closure or primitive procedure is part of the final value 
      of an expression entered interactively in the interpreter.  Section 3.3 of EoPL may be helpful.
- Add **begin** to the parser and interpreter. 
- Add two  interfaces to your interpreter: **rep** and **eval-one-exp** as described below).

## You are to provide two interfaces to your interpreter

**A.   A normal interactive interface (read-eval-print loop)  (rep)**

This interface will be used primarily for your interactive testing of your interpreter and to facilitate interaction if you bring the interpreter to me for help.  The user should load your code, type 
    (rep)
and start entering Scheme expressions.  Your read-eval-print loop should display a prompt that is different from the normal Scheme prompt.  It should read and evaluate an expression, return the value, and then prompt for the next expression.  If the value happens to be (or contain) a closure or prim-proc, your interpreter should not return the internal representation of the procedure, but instead it should return `<interpreter-procedure>`.  For debugging purposes, you might want to write a separate procedure called rep-debug that behaves like rep, except that it displays the internal representation of everything that it returns, including procedures.  Using trace on your eval-exp procedure can be a big help, but be prepared to wade through a lot of output!  

If the user types (exit) as an input expression to your interpreter, (some later version of) your interpreter should exit and simply return to the Scheme top-level; for now it is okay if your interpreter “crashes”.  What happens when the user enters illegal Scheme code or encounters a run-time error?   Ideally, the interpreter should print an error message and return to the "read" portion of the "read-eval-print" loop.  Think about how you might do that.  But we do not expect you to do it for this assignment. Again it can just crash your interpreter.  A sample transcript follows:

    > (rep)
    --> (+ 3 5)
    8
    --> (list 6 (lambda (x) x) 7)
    (6 <interpreter-procedure> 7)
    --> (cons 'a '(b c d))
    (a b c d)
    --> ((lambda (x)
          ((lambda (y)
                (+ x y))
            5))
        6)
    11  
    --> (((lambda (f)
           ((lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y))))
            (lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y))))))
        (lambda (g)
            (lambda (n)
                (if (zero? n)
                    1
                    (* n (g (- n 1)))))))
            6)
        720
    -->(exit)

**B. Single-procedure interface:  (eval-one-exp parsed-expression)**

In addition to the (rep) interactive interface, you must provide the procedure eval-one-exp.  The code below is intended to clarify this procedure’s function, not to make you rewrite your interpreter.  You will of course need to adapt it to your particular program.  It may be possible to arrange things so that your rep procedure can call eval-one-exp.

(define eval-one-exp 
 	   (lambda (exp) (eval-exp (parse-exp exp))))))

    >(eval-one-exp '(- (* 2 3) (* 6 3)))
    -12
    >

**Note that** eval-one-exp **does not have to be available to the user when running your interpreter interactively**.  It only has to be available from the normal Scheme prompt.  The interpreter test cases will call this procedure.  Testing of your rep loop will need to be done by hand.
