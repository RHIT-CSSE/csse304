# CSSE 304 Assignment 0

Ok the main goal of this assignment is to get your development environment setup.  This term we’re using a new version of scheme than we have in years past called “Racket” – this a flavor of scheme that is mostly compatible with standard scheme but has a couple of more modern tweaks.  The reason we’re using is that it has much more robust debugging capability than classic scheme.

You should be able to download it here: https://download.racket-lang.org/

On my system windows complained about an unverified executable – it should be safe to “Run Anyway” to start the installer.  Once installed there will be at least 2 apps one called Racket and called DrRacket.  DrRacket is the one you’ll want to use – it is the IDE for Racket.

I also recommend you clone a local copy of the course repo (click the green “Code” button on that page and select your preferred download method).   You won’t submit your assignments via git but it’s nice to get a local version with all the content you’ll need.

Watch [this video](https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ef292e55-7183-4fb9-a51d-ade90150fece) where I show some basics about running code in Racket.

Take the already written code in A0.rkt, run in your scheme interpter to verify it works, and them submit it Gradescope for grading (Gradescope link on the course Moodle).  

If this works well your environment is setup.

# Continue forward

That's it for A0.

One of the best things you can do to set yourself up for success in
304 is work a little bit ahead in the Schemeathon.  To that end, I
encourage you to at least move on and do A01 tonight.  

If you're a real go getter, see if you can get through A02 tonight or
tomorrow.  At the end of A02 is an optional problem I think almost any
student will find at least a little interesting.
