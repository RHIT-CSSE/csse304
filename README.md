# CSSE304

A repo containing all content for Programming Languages and Compilers.
I encourage you to clone this repo, but please pull occasionally as
the content does get updated.  Do NOT fork this repo and then push all
the homework assignment solutions to a public github.  If we discover
you doing this - it's academic misconduct.

# Textbooks

- [Excerpts from the 1st Edition of EoPL](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/pluginfile.php/3547225/mod_resource/content/0/EoPL-1.pdf). This will 
be abbreviated in my documents as *EoPL-1*.  The first edition did not assume the reader knew scheme, so this excerpt is an alternate partial introduction to the rest of EoPL.

- [The Scheme Programming Language](http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/) 4th edition by R. Kent
Dybvig. This book will be abbreviated as *TSPL*; it serves
primarily as an introduction to and reference manual for Scheme.

- [Essentials of Programming
Languages](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.rose-hulman.edu/lib/rosehulman-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3338861)
Now free through the Rose-Hulman library.  This is the main
textbook. It will be abbreviated as *EoPL*.  This book is terse, so
you will have to read it carefully.
