I've deviated from Claude's version of these classes

# Day 1

Main thing is to introduce define datatype.  I went through an object like example with a student/teacher/person datatype and then do the bintree example.  I do an example algorithm and code an example tree function.

Then I compare/contrast function design approach with union types to OO encapsulation oriented approach.

# Day 2

I wanted to focus more on the benefits of parsing

I did the bintree parse example Then I did a more advanced parsing
that used math exps which require parsing flat data because the
parents are < and >.

Then I talk about parsing lc expressions and go through the slides on
11b, finishing with adding set! to the interpreter.
