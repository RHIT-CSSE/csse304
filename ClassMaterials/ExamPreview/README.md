## Practice exams

202210 & 202220 should be close.  No imperative form question for you.

## Topics

Points are tentative

* [20 points] Call/cc programming question (released early)

* [15 points] Call/cc evaluation paper part.  Always asks you to evaluate call/cc
  expressions using the techniques we talked about in class.
  
* [15 points] CPS question - convert code to continuation passing style (could be
  datastructure, could be lambda)

* [15 points] Typing question - similar to A19

* [15 points] Follow the Grammar question - very similar to what you did on
  exam 1.  Follow the grammar!

* [20 points] Interpreter question - Uses 17a (or later) as a base.  Could
  potentially involve any part of the code - but I won't limit you to
  expand syntax
