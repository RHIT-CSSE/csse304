# Exam 1 Guide

Updated Winter 2024-2025

# Exam Structure

* 2.5 hours evening exam

* Paper part which you turn in & then start computer part

* Music (via headphones) and quiet drinks/snacks encouraged

# Practice

The best way to prepare for Exam1 is to review the assignments and to 
practice under similar exam
conditions.  The SampleExams directory at the root of the repo has
previous exams.

More recent is usually better.  If you want to dive into the
PreBuffalo exams, I think 202020 is reasonably similar to my approach.

# General Guidance

* DON'T take the exam if you're sick.  Don't take the exam if you're
  coughing a ton but you passed a COVID test.

* The time is a part of the exam.  Keep an eye on your time & don't
  get stuck on one problem.

* These problems will be new - be careful about "adapting" old solutions

* Know how to use the debugging capability of Racket including trace

* There is *some* partial credit but it does not depend on percentage
  of test cases.  Note we always look at your code and will not
  usually award credit for solutions that attempt to "game" the test
  case.

# Topics

The exam will cover the materials from days 1 - 8 and the assignments 0 - 6.
