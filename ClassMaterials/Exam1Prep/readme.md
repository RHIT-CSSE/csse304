# Exam 1 Guide

Updated Fall 2022-2023

# Exam Structure

* 2.5 hours evening exam

* Paper part which you turn in & then start computer part

* Music (via headphones) and quiet drinks/snacks encouraged

* I require masks

# Practice

The best way to prepare for Exam1 is to practice under similar exam
conditions.  The SampleExams directory at the root of the repo has
previous exams.

More recent is usually better.  If you want to dive into the
PreBuffalo exams, I think 202020 is reasonably similar to my approach.

# General Guidance

* DON'T take the exam if you're sick.  Don't take the exam if you're
  coughing a ton but you passed a COVID test.

* The time is a part of the exam.  Keep an eye on your time & don't
  get stuck on one problem.

* These problems will be new - be careful about "adapting" old solutions

* Know how to use the debugging capability of Racket including trace

* There is *some* partial credit but it does not depend on percentage
  of test cases.  Note we always look at your code and will not
  usually award credit for solutions that attempt to "game" the test
  case.

# Paper part topics

* box and pointer diagrams

* functions that return functions

* map, filter, apply

* using lambdas to store data

* derivation tree

* free and bound variables

# Computer part topics

* Recursive functions both basic and advanced.  Advanced usually requires helper functions of some sort.

* Building a "data structure" with lambdas

* Dealing with a language and "following the grammar"

* Function transforming functions
