# CSSE 304 Syllabus

# Course Topics

## RHIT Catalog Course Description

Syntax and semantics of programming languages. Grammars, parsing, data
types, control flow, parameter passing, run-time storage management,
binding times, functional programming and procedural abstraction,
syntactic extensions, continuations, language design and
evaluation. Students will explore several language features by writing
an interpreter that implements them.

## Instructor commentary

This course presents an implementation
approach to the study of programming language concepts.  Rather than
looking at several programming language features "from the outside"
(only a user's perspective) We will instead get an inside
view by implementing many of the features ourselves, *via* a
series of interpreters (the languages will mostly be subsets of
Racket).  We will use the Racket programming language to provide a
laboratory environment in which to write the interpreters and to
illustrate various programming paradigms and concepts.

Learning in this course is not a spectator sport. You must engage with all of the class materials and during class. You should start working on the homework assignments early. 

# Texts (all are online and free)

Texts provide some good background but readings are optional.

- [Excerpts from the 1st Edition of EoPL](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=4670066). This will 
be abbreviated in my documents as *EoPL-1*.  The first edition did not assume the reader knows Scheme (or Racket,) so this excerpt is an alternate partial introduction to the rest of EoPL.

- [The Scheme Programming Language](http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/) 4th edition by R. Kent
Dybvig. This book will be abbreviated as *TSPL*; it serves
primarily as an introduction to and reference manual for Scheme and to certain degree to Racket.

- [Essentials of Programming
Languages](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rosehulman-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3338861)
Now free through the Rose-Hulman library.  This is the main
textbook. It will be abbreviated as *EoPL*.  This book is terse, so
you will have to read it carefully.

Grade cutoffs start at the usual ones (e.g. 90+ is an A, etc.)  You must have a passing average on the exams to pass the course.

I will sometimes adjust grades upward or downward due to specific circumstances - if you have a special situation contact me.

# Deadlines and Late Policy

The deadlines of all homeworks are listed on the schedule page.

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This course has no ’late day’ policy and late assignments are generally worth 0 points unless you have made arrangements.

However we understand that situations can arise. We handle all situations on a case-by-case basis. Here are some general guidelines:

* The usual extension is 24 hours or for extreme circumstances 48 hours
* We expect to be notified as soon as is feasible. If you are very ill, we understand that that might be slightly after the assignment due date. For other situations, it’s usually possible to notify us in advance.
* We keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be overusing the privilege we will stop allowing extensions.
* If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble completing the assignment (e.g. a bug you can’t fix or just difficulty understanding) get help from an instructor. Don’t assume that more time will fix the problem; plan to get help.

#### Special Arrangements

If circumstances have caused you to miss/fail several assignments OR
if your current situation in PLC seems overwhelming, you should
contact the professor right away.  Sometime I can find special
accommodations but this is very difficult because of the tight
schedule of PLC.

The best chance of success is when these problems are addressed
quickly - but it never hurts to have a discussion, however
unsalvageable the situation may feel.  Please talk to your professor
if you are having problems!

# Academic Honesty

It is critical to maintain academic integrity. It is essential for all
students to cite any and all sources of help received in completing
coursework. This practice not only fosters a culture of honesty and
transparency but also prevents misunderstandings that might otherwise
escalate to formal proceedings. Students should also be aware of what
is appropriate help on homework assignments – <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared Documents/Pilot Integrity Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy - What Constitutes Misconduct.docx?d=w72d3dc4b233d4df68e10736359a06c80&csf=1&web=1&e=QWvFcM">see policy here</a> ). In general, academic misconduct results in negative points on an assignment and an F in the course on exams. All the work you turn in must be your own. You may use appropriate assistance from the instructor and the TAs.

If a case of suspected misconduct arises, it will be submitted to the
CSSE Integrity Committee for review (see <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared Documents/Pilot Integrity Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy - Procedures.docx?d=wf4c70babf3ac434ba29d5518dca9f877&csf=1&web=1&e=1efwlT">policies and procedures here</a>
and <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared Documents/Pilot Integrity Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy - Penalties %26 Evidence.docx?d=w916e293ca31a4493bdbdd6b78ed2d3dd&csf=1&web=1&e=wCWF2K">possible penalties here</a>). The process includes an initial review
of the evidence by the committee, a time for students to explain or
admit to potential misconduct, and potentially a hearing to examine
the circumstances and evidence. Students are encouraged to continue
their studies and engage with the course material and instructor
normally throughout the investigation.

Beyond the policy of this course, the Student Handbook and
Rose-Hulman’s Academic Rules and Procedures describe penalties and
processes invoked as a consequence if academic misconduct (such as
cheating, plagiarizing, or interfering with the academic progress of
other students) takes place.  It is the responsibility of each student
to know and follow Rose-Hulman’s rules about academic integrity.

Online Access Requirements:

Rose-Hulman welcomes students from around the world, and encourages faculty, staff and students to travel around the world.
