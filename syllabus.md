# Compsci 304 Syllabus

# Course Topics

## RHIT Catalog Course Description

Syntax and semantics of programming languages. Grammars, parsing, data
types, control flow, parameter passing, run-time storage management,
binding times, functional programming and procedural abstraction,
syntactic extensions, continuations, language design and
evaluation. Students will explore several language features by writing
an interpreter that implements them.

## Instructor commentary

This course presents an implementation
approach to the study of programming language concepts.  Rather than
looking at several programming language features "from the outside"
(only a user's perspective) We will instead get an inside
view by implementing many of the features ourselves, *via* a
series of interpreters (the languages will mostly be subsets of
Scheme).  We will use the Scheme programming language to provide a
laboratory environment in which to write the interpreters and to
illustrate various programming paradigms and concepts.

# Required Texts (all are online and free)

- [Excerpts from the 1st Edition of EoPL](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/pluginfile.php/3081999/mod_resource/content/1/EoPL-1.pdf). This will 
be abbreviated in my documents as *EoPL-1*.  The first edition did not assume the reader knew scheme, so this excerpt is an alternate partial introduction to the rest of EoPL.

- [The Scheme Programming Language](http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/) 4th edition by R. Kent
Dybvig. This book will be abbreviated as *TSPL*; it serves
primarily as an introduction to and reference manual for Scheme.

- [Essentials of Programming
Languages](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.rose-hulman.edu/lib/rosehulman-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3338861)
Now free through the Rose-Hulman library.  This is the main
textbook. It will be abbreviated as *EoPL*.  This book is terse, so
you will have to read it carefully.

# Development Environment

We will be using Chez Scheme (note that *chez* is a French word that rhymes with *way*).  Details of the environment setup are in Assignment 0.

# Grades

| Grade Component                                            | Percentage   |
| :---------------------------------------                   | :----------- |
| Homework, quizzes, in-class exercises, interperter project | 40%          |
| Exam 1                                                     | 15%          |
| Exam 2                                                     | 20%          |
| Final                                                      | 25%          |

Grade cutoffs start at the usual ones (e.g. 90+ is an A, etc.)  On
some occasions I revise them downward (e.g. 88+ is an A) after reviewing all grades at the end of the term.  I don't curve individual assignments and I don't decide on the cutoffs until the very end.  Note that 65 is my usual cutoff for an F.

I will sometimes adjust grades upward or downward due to specific circumstances - if you have a special situation contact me.

# Deadlines and Late Policy

The deadlines of all homeworks are listed on the schedule page.

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This course has no ’late day’ policy and late assignments are generally worth 0 points unless you have made arrangements.

However we understand that situations can arise. We handle all situations on a case-by-case basis. Here are some general guidelines:

* The usual extension is 24 hours or for extreme circumstances 48 hours
* We expect to be notified as soon as is feasible. If you are very ill, we understand that that might be slightly after the assignment due date. For other situations, it’s usually possible to notify us in advance.
* We keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be overusing the privilege we will stop allowing extensions.
* If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble completing the assignment (e.g. a bug you can’t fix or just difficulty understanding) get help from an instructor. Don’t assume that more time will fix the problem; plan to get help.

#### Special Arrangements

If circumstances have caused you to miss/fail several assignments OR
if your current situation in PLC seems overwhelming, you should
contact the professor right away.  Sometime I can find special
accommodations but this is very difficult because of the tight
schedule of PLC.

The best chance of success is when these problems are addressed
quickly - but it never hurts to have a discussion, however
unsalvageable the situation may feel.  Please talk to your professor
if you are having problems!

# Academic Honesty

You are encouraged to discuss the problems and general approaches to
solving them with other students.  But when it comes to writing code,
it should be your own work (or the work of your pair if it is a
pair-programming assignment).  Especially if you are having trouble understanding
how some pre-defined Scheme procedure  works or pinning down a run-time or logic
error in your program, by all means talk to someone about it.

If you use someone else's ideas (including code from a previous term
PLC course) in your solution (or any other work that you do anywhere),
you should:

- give credit to that person in a comment at the beginning of your file
- be sure that you understand it as well as if it were your own.

Beginning the process of producing your solution with an electronic
copy of work done by other students is never appropriate.

<strong> On exams</strong> All work on exams is to be individual.  Of course you may not copy work done by other people who are taking or who have taken that exam.   

<b>Penalties:</b>

The minimum penalty for a unintentional first homework offense is
twice the value of the assignment.  Thus if you cheat on an assignment
that is worth a total of 60 points, your score for that assignment
will be -60.

If cheating is intentional, the penalty is an immediate F in the
course - even for one assignment, even one time.

All academic dishonesty will also be reported to the dean of students
through the normal Rose-Hulman process which may level further
penalties.
